# ReduxPattern
Functional / Redux architectural pattern in C# backend

-----
### Why bother?

Functional programming has a long history for back-end developers since ancient time (think of LISP from 1958), and started to become more popular in front-end community thanks to the wide adoption to Redux. In architectural space similar concept has been applied, such as event sourcing, FRP, and actor model, to some extent. However most of these architectural patterns are heavy-weighted frameworks, i.e. majority of your system / components have to conform the same design pattern, leading to barriers to entry, high migration cost, etc.

This C# library is a simple coding pattern that allows you to reap some benefits of functional programming with little learning curve, minimal migration effort and absolutely no change to the platform / technology of your choice.
